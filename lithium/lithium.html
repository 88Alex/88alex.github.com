    <h1>The Lithium-OS Project</h1>
    <p>Lithium-OS is a simple 32-bit console-based operating system for the x86 architecture.</p>
    <p>Lithium-OS was designed to be simple and easy-to-use, but actually useful.</p>
    <h2>Principles</h2>
    <p>In the modern world, there are 2 types of operating systems- 
      the mega-powerful yet bloated major operating systems (i.e. Windows, Mac) 
      and extremely simple systems in which you can't even print a document.
      Lithium-OS attempts a compromise between the two.
